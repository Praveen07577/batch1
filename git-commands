Work Space: When we create a new file or modified files would be saved by default here.
Staging/ Index area: It has the config details like modifications, commit, etc
Local Repo: Files that are ready to be pushed to the central repo would be saved here. 

To see the files that are available in Work Space we use the command git status
Sending files from workspace to staging area git add file name. 
Sending them to the Local Repo we use git commit -m “label msg” file
Label msg: mentioning the trouble report numbers, info, purpose, modifications etc., 
To check the files in Local repo, we use git log.

To see the files in the Local repo, we use git show cid(commit ID) 
To get the file back from Staging area, we need to use git reset HEAD file name.
To get the file back from Local Repo, we need to use git reset - - soft cid (commit ID).
